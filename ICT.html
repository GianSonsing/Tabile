<h1 style="text-align:center;"> INTRO TO ICT 2ND QUARTER / EVENTS IN 2ND QUARTER </h1>
<p style="text-align:center;"> KINDLY SHOW RESPECT AND BE POLITE WHEN READING THE DATA </p>



<ol>
  <li>
    <h1>The 3 Structures of a Web Page</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>First I learned in this lesson is that the HTML contains the content, while CSS contains the presentation, and overall, JavaScript contains the behavior and the interaction of how people will interact with your webpage.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
<img src="p.jpeg" height="400px"width="1200px">

  <li>
    <h1>Intro to the CSS</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>I learned that CSS or Cascading Style Sheets help make editing easier, faster, more understandable, and properly organized. There are many kinds of edits you can make depending on the theme of the page. It helps save time and avoid unnecessary codes.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
<img src="p1.jpeg" height="400px" width="1200px"
  <li>
    <h1>Learning About Different Ways for CSS</h1></li>
    <ul>
      <p>I learned that we have Inline, External, and Embedded styles. These 3 types are different — Inline styling is added directly into the tag itself. For Embedded, it uses the style tag and the necessary selectors. Lastly, for External, I learned that you need to have 3 files: the TXT file, the HTML file, and the CSS design file.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>

<img src="css.jpg" height="400px"width="1200px">

  <li>
    <h1>Structures of CSS</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>I learned that without knowing how to structure the CSS you will be using, your CSS knowledge will be slower and more complicated since you do not know your main goal or objective in using CSS.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
<img src="ccs.jpeg" height="400px"width="1200px">
  <li>
    <h1>Inline / Block Level Elements</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>I learned that this gives a general idea of having easy editing in your output. I now know how the tags I learned in previous years differ — by single sentence editing and single paragraph editing. I now know how to properly edit the information I will be using.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>

<img src="pic3.jpeg" width="1200px" height="400px">

<li>
    <h1>CSS Comments</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>I learned here as the same in HMTL comments, this can help you with editing your output and I won't be shown unless you want it to be. It helps with organization and what you want to show.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>

<img src="pic6.jpeg" width="1200px" height="400px">


  <li>
    <h1>Class Rules / Classes</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>I have learned the basic steps and easy methods on how to code my outputs or upcoming projects more easily. It makes my life better and my work faster, as I can use shortcuts in editing my content and communicating with my viewers.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>

<img src="se.png" height="400px" width="1200px"

  <li>
    <h1>CSS Selectors and Navigation Bar</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>In this lesson, I had a hard time at first, but as time passed, I learned that there are 6 types of selectors. I also learned that it should start with a # and then I started to understand it. I also tried using navigation bars, horizontal ones that helped with the lesson and my e-portfolio.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
<img src="pic4.jpeg" width="1200px" height="400px">

 <li>
    <h1>Pseudo-classes</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>In this lesson, I had a also a very hard time understanding the contents at first, but as time was also passing by. , I started to understand it. Pseudo-classes are also a short-cut for everything and to make making the website easier.
    </ul>
  </li>

<img src="pic5.jpeg" width="1200px" height="400px"

li>
    <h1>CSS Dimensions</h1>
    <ul>
      <p>This lesson is pretty simple. It talks about the content and dimensions you want your viewers to see in your webpage. What they shouldn't and what you want to show them. These Class Dimensions help with making editing your web browser faster and more efficient.</p>
    </ul>
  </li>
